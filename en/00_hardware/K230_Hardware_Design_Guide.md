## 3. Schematic Design Recommendations

### 3.1. Minimum System Design

#### 3.1.1 Clock Requirements

The main system of K230 requires a 24MHz high-speed clock, and the RTC of the PMU subsystem requires a 32.768kHz low-speed clock.

Table 3-1 shows the parameters of the allowable clock sources for K230.

| Frequency | Accuracy | Level |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| 32.768KHz | 20ppm    | 1.8V  |
| 24MHz     | 20ppm    | 1.8V  |

It is recommended to use clock sources with an accuracy of 20ppm or higher.

##### High-Speed Clock

The recommended passive crystal connection method is shown in Figure 3-1.
![Figure 3-1 K230 Crystal Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image012.png)
Figure 3-1 K230 Crystal Circuit
Note:

- The selected capacitors need to match the load capacitance of the crystal, and it is recommended to use NPO material.
- It is recommended to use a 4-pin SMD crystal, with 2 GND pins fully connected to the ground to enhance the system clock's ESD interference resistance.
- To improve the startup speed, a 1MΩ resistor can be added between the IN pin and the OUT pin.

The recommended active crystal connection method is shown in Figure 3-2.
![Figure 3-2 K230 Active Crystal Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image013.png)
Figure 3-2 K230 Active Crystal Circuit
During operation, the crystal output is connected to the CLK24M_XIN pin of K230, and the CLK24M_XOUT pin is left floating.

##### Low-Speed Clock

The K230 chip has a built-in PMU circuit, and the single board needs to provide a clock for the PMU circuit. The recommended circuit is shown in Figure 3-3.
![Figure 3-3 K230 RTC Clock Passive Crystal Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image014.png)
Figure 3-3 K230 RTC Clock Passive Crystal Circuit
The recommended active crystal connection method is shown in Figure 3-4.
![Figure 3-4 K230 RTC Clock Active Crystal Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image015.png)
Figure 3-4 K230 RTC Clock Active Crystal Circuit

During operation, the crystal output is connected to the CLK32K768_XIN pin of K230, and the CLK32K768_XOUT pin is left floating.
Note:

- When using an active crystal, the NC places in the above active crystal circuits need to be connected with a 0Ω resistor.

#### 3.1.2 Reset Circuit

The hardware reset of K230 is achieved through the RSTN pin, which is active low.
If using a button reset, it is recommended to add a 100nF capacitor to the reset signal pin to eliminate reset signal jitter, enhance anti-interference ability, and prevent system abnormal reset caused by mis-triggering.
The reset circuit schematic is shown in Figure 3-5.
![Figure 3-5 K230 Reset Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image016.png)
Figure 3-5 K230 Reset Circuit

#### 3.1.3 System Boot Sequence

The K230 chip provides four boot modes, which can be configured through the BOOT0 and BOOT1 pins.
Table 3-2 shows the boot modes of K230 under different configurations.

| BOOT0 | BOOT1 | K230       | K230D      |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 0     | 0     | NOR FLASH  | NOR FLASH  |
| 1     | 0     | NAND FLASH | NAND FLASH |
| 0     | 1     | MMC0       | MMC0       |
| 1     | 1     | MMC1       | MMC1       |

Table 3-2 Boot Mode Description

Note:

- When all four boot modes fail, it will jump to USB/UART boot.

Figure 3-6 shows the recommended BOOT circuit
![Figure 3-6 K230 BOOT Circuit](../../zh/00_hardware/images/HDG/image017.png)

Among them, JTAG_TCK, JTAG_TDI, JTAG_TMS, and JTAG_RST are recommended to be pulled up with 10kΩ, and JTAG_TDO is left floating.
K230 must use the CKLink series debugger provided by Pingtouge Semiconductor Co., Ltd., otherwise, the chip cannot be debugged.

When designing the SD card circuit, note:

- The decoupling capacitors for SD card pins should not be omitted and should be placed close to the card slot.
- ESD devices should be placed near the SD card slot for each signal.

Supports two output channels OUT0 and OUT1, which can be used to enable power supplies. In a cold start state, the PMU only enables the long press interrupt of INT0 and the high-level input interrupt of INT4 as triggers for PMU module startup. OUT0 and OUT1 default to low level with an initial pull-down resistance of about 40Ω. Upon receiving either of these two interrupts, OUT0 is pulled high, and OUT1 is pulled high after approximately 50ms. OUT0 and OUT1 can be used to control the enable pins of external PMICs or for other purposes.

Note:

- For the DDR chips used by the K230, the power supply must be on the same power network as the main chip.
- Modules with the same voltage requirements can use the same power source if the voltage accuracy and current requirements are met. For applications with low precision requirements, analog modules like ADCs can also be connected to the power source used by digital modules after isolation.
- The K230 integrates a DDR_Vref power supply for the chip's DDR controller. For external chips, the reference design for the LPDDR3 VREF power supply is shown in Figure 3-39.

It is recommended to use resistors with an accuracy of ±1%. The reference design for the external LPDDR4 VREF power supply is shown in Figure 3-40.

#### 3.8.4 Dynamic Voltage Scaling

The power supplies for the CPU and KPU in the K230 support dynamic voltage scaling to ensure high performance and low power consumption. The adjustable voltage nodes for the CPU are shown in Table 3-7.

| Voltage Node | Voltage (V) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| V_typical    | 0.8         |
| V_high       | 0.9         |
| V_ultrahigh  | 1.0         |
| V_low        | 0.7         |
| V_retention  | 0.48        |

Table 3-7 CPU Adjustable Voltage Nodes

Among them, V_retention is the voltage node for the DDR retention function. The adjustable voltage nodes for the KPU are shown in Table 3-8.

| Voltage Node | Voltage (V) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| V_typical    | 0.8         |
| V_high       | 0.9         |
| V_ultrahigh  | 1.0         |
| V_low        | 0.7         |

## 4. PCB Design Recommendations

### 4.1 High-Speed PCB Design Recommendations

#### 4.1.1 DDR Design

Impedance Control: Single-ended DDR 50Ω, Differential (clock clk, data dqs) 100Ω;
Crosstalk Requirements: Follow the 3W rule;
Length Matching Requirements: Ensure the same number of vias for the same type of signal lines, and avoid more than 2 layer changes for vias;
The internal DDR routing length of the chip is shown in Table 4-1. When routing on the PCB, ensure that the total length of internal and external routing meets the length matching requirements.
It is strongly recommended to refer to the design of the K230 EVB, including routing and capacitor selection and placement.

Table 4-1 Internal DDR Trace Lengths

Within LPDDR3 byte groups, DQ can be swapped, but DQ swapping is not supported between bytes or between byte groups. For LPDDR4, DQ can be swapped within byte groups, DQ swapping is not supported between bytes, but byte swapping within channel groups is supported.

It is recommended to follow the EVB swap order for routing. If you modify the swap during your own design, you need to adjust the DDR training code. Please contact FAE in advance.
