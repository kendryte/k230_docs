Compile buildroot and add tools for wireless use.

The WIFI module is reset in uboot when the system starts. Source code:

src/little/uboot/board/canaan/k230_canmv/board.c : board_late_init

After the WIFI module is started in the system, power on and off the WIFI module if wlan down/up. Source code:

```c
&gpio1 {
    status = "okay";
};

&mmc_sd0{
    status = "okay";
    io_fixed_1v8;
    rx_delay_line = <0x00>;
    tx_delay_line = <0x00>;
    bcmdhd_wlan {
        compatible = "android,bcmdhd_wlan";
        gpio_wl_reg_on = <&port1 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
    };
};
```

STA is the abbreviation of Station. It is a terminal site device in the wireless network and can be regarded as a client. Generally speaking, the device in STA mode itself does not accept wireless access. The device is connected to the AP node. For network access, our mobile phone acts as an STA to connect to the router.

AP is the abbreviation of Access Point, which is a wireless access point. It is the central node of a wireless network and can be regarded as a server. As the central node of a network, it provides wireless access services. Other wireless devices are allowed to access the node. All wireless signal data of devices accessing the node must pass through it for exchange and mutual access. General wireless routers, gateways, and hotspots work in AP mode, and AP nodes are allowed to connect to each other.

#### 2.15.3.1 STA test

```shell
ifconfig -a
ifconfig  wlan0 up
wpa_supplicant -D nl80211 -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -B
wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan
wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_result
wpa_cli -i wlan0 add_network
wpa_cli -i wlan0 set_network 1 psk '"12345678"'
wpa_cli -i wlan0 set_network 1 ssid '"wifi_test"'
wpa_cli -i wlan0 select_network 1
udhcpc -i wlan0 -q
```

#### 2.15.3.2 AP test

```shell
[root@canaan ~ ]#cat /etc/hostapd.conf
ctrl_interface=/var/run/hostapd
driver=nl80211
ieee80211n=1
interface=wlan1
hw_mode=g
channel=6
beacon_int=100
dtim_period=1
ssid=k230_ap
auth_algs=1
ap_isolate=0
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
```

```shell
ifconfig wlan1 192.168.1.1
udhcpd /etc/udhcpd.conf &
hostapd /etc/hostapd.conf &
```

sta can directly connect to the passwordless "k230_ap" hotspot.
